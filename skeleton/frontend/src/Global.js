            '"Americans do not take their justiciable problems to lawyers because they do not consider these problems to be legal, frequently feel that they are quite capable of handling these problems on their own, and often do not believe that anything can be done about them-by anyone."',
            `"Americans' descriptions of how they do handle their justice problems reveal that the kind of assistance that they would appreciate would likely have three qualities: it would be timely, appearing at a moment when they recognize that they have a problem; it would be targeted, specific to their actual needs; and it would be trustworthy, coming from sources that they believe are responsible and working in their good interests."`,

Examples of this strategy in report page 731-32. A challenge presented by this strategy includes the lack of providers in rural communities.'

Households more vulnerable to the adverse consequences of problems were less likely to take action to remedy them. Pgs. 112-113',

            'The authors detail conclusions made by a British research group regarding the four components of access to justice: (1) formal and effective access to the legal system that does not exclude those who may not have adequate access to technology, (2) access to an effective hearing via representation and the ability to interact with third parties, (3) access to a decision in accordance with substantive law, and (4) access to remedy.',
            'The alternative dispute resolution (ADR) movement was originally viewed as one way to improve access to justice by minimizing the power imbalance among litigants and enhance the rights of vulnerable and self represented litigants. However, over time it evolved to actually curtail access to justice.',
            '“Lack of meaningful consent, then, impairs the fairness of [the alternative dispute resolution] ADR processes, because parties fail to know what they are agreeing and committing to, nor understand what the possible outcomes of the processes are.” This impact access to justice because unmeaningful consent infringes on autonomy and decision making during meditation and arbitration.',
            'Because legal conflicts begin prior to entering courts, access to justice solutions should look to all stages of disputes/conflict, especially those earlier in the process.',
            'Courtroom resolution processes can impede access to justice because “when potential litigants do meet a lawyer or enter the court system, their perceptions and motivations change, and they may withdraw or modify their claims when encountering the laws relevant to their dispute, finding new information, or after realizing the high costs they may incur during the legal process.”',
            'In the United States, civil trials have decreased over the last four decades. The number of federal civil cases resolved by trial is only 1.8%',
            '“Direct judicial activity prompts the early termination of legal cases by persuading litigating sides to settle, thus creating a ‘settlement culture.’” As a result, judges have seen a change in their roles and tasks, and have moved from adjudication to case management. The focus for judges has been to reach resolutions as quickly as possible and encourage litigants to settle.'
